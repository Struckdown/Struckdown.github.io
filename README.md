# Struckdown.github.io
A website about Boris Fleysher, to showcase and store some things I've done, like built this website because I wanted to!

It can be run locally with ```bundle exec jekyll serve``` after setting up Ruby. See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll)
