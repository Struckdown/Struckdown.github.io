In Winter 2019, I took INT D 450: Computers and Games, which is the final course in the [Game Development Certificate](https://www.ualberta.ca/interdisciplinary-studies/computer-game-development) at the University of Alberta, which has us build a 30-minute game from start to finish using some game engine. Sounds a lot like CMPUT 250. Except, this time, we're not having our hands held. We chose the engine to work with, the platform to develop for, the target audience, the theme, the mood, the art direction, everything. Everything was made by us for this project.

The team:
Boris Fleysher - Producer, Programmer, Level Design
Stephen Melvin - Writer, Story Direction
Nate Spasiuk - Lead Designer, Artist, BGM
Andrew Somerville - Audio SFX, Programming support
Wang Dong - Programmer, Level Design
Guanfang Dong - Programmer, Level Design

As well, we had support from [Jeff Cho](jeffcho.com) and [Shelby Carleton](https://twitter.com/bdotexe?lang=en) as our Executive Producers, who mostly served as guidance and primary testers.

Our game was nomiated for "Best Game Development Practices", which we tied for first place with another team that was also incredible, [Ubiquitous Mayonnaise](https://itch.io/profile/ubiquitous-mayonnaise), who made Where The Flame Took You in that semester.
 
I personally worked on building many of the levels, protyping the crystal chasing mechanic, the monster's behaviour, implementing and integrating audio, animations and dialogue, and as the first person to go to when something goes wrong. I was responsible for ensuring a timly delivery of our project, including the weekly milestones and leading team meetings each week.
