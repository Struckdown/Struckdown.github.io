In Winter 2017, I took CMPUT 250: Computers and Games, which is the first course in the [Game Development Certificate](https://www.ualberta.ca/interdisciplinary-studies/computer-game-development) at the University of Alberta, which has us build a 30-minute game from start to finish using some game engine. In the past, games had been made using the Neverwinter Nights engine, but this semester we were assigned either Gamemaker Studio or RPG Maker VX Ace to use as our engine. Our team was given RPG Maker VX Ace and we set off to make whatever we could with it.

The team:
* Jonathan Bates - Producer, Audio
* Boris Fleysher - Lead Programmer, Designer
* George Owen - Lead Designer, Art and Sprites
* Brynn Lewis - Lead Writer
* Kevin Lim - Programmer
* Canopus Tong - Programmer

As well, we had support from Andrew Bernakevitch as our Executive Producer.

Our game was nomiated for Writing and Story, Audio, Technical Achievement, and Game of the Year and competed against games made in Neverwinter Nights, Gamemaker Studio and RPG Maker from the year. While this made it challenging for most fields to be even comparable, we did end up winning the Audio category. 

I personally worked on building the levels, implementing parts of the lantern mechanic, and implementation of the boss mechanic at the end of the game. I also did almost all the puzzles and bonus areas, and integration of the dialogue into the game.
