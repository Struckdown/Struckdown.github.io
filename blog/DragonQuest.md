In Fall 2017, I took STS 350: Understanding Video Games at the University of Alberta, which focused on game principles, such as their history, culture and aspects of their design.
We were also tasked to make a short text-based game as one of our projects, from which we made DragonQuest.
DragonQuest is a game made in [Twine 2](https://twinery.org) that has the player play as a dragon and play through some text based
mini-games, such as combat scenarios.

The Team:
* Boris Fleysher
* Shardul Shah
* Ceegan Hale
* Aditya Parihar
* Charles Zhai
* Wang Dong

I was overall responsible of the general implementation of the game, as well as bug fixing and general QA. I primarily worked as one of the lead developers and designer for this project, designing all the combat scenarios and their implementations, as well as the Wizard mini-game and Empire mini-game in two of the endings. I also designed and implemented the cavern mini-dungeon.

Here is the player encountering an ogre, which starts a turn based combat sequence.
