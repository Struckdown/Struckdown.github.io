In Winter 2019, I decided to participate in HackED 2019 at the University of Alberta, making this my first ever Hackathon. I didn't know much of what to expect going in, but I showed up and stumbled across some people and I knew, joining their team.

The team:

* [Frederic Sauve-Hoover](https://github.com/rsauvehoove)(
* [Kevin de Haan](https://github.com/kdehaan)
* [Logan Yue](https://github.com/LoganYue)
* [Boris Fleysher](https://github.com/Struckdown)

We created an online app that can be run on any GitHub repository to return a line graph over time of the repository's "Sentimental" state. Using commit messages, it would evaluate the sentimental change at each point, and then create a line graph. We pulled data from Github using their API. We then used a sentiment analysis tool for the actual analysis, followed by JavaScript charts to build the graph itself.

Considering I had no background in building web apps or anything related to React or JavaScript, this was a bit tougher for me. I ended up focusing on the graphs and getting the charts to work, as well as just general bug fixes.

Unfortunately, I don't think our app works anymore, and the only screenshot is posted here on [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/git-emotional)
