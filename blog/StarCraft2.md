In Fall 2018, I took CMPUT 350: Advanced Games Programming which focuses on advanced AI in games and C++. In this class, our project for the last half of the course was to build a StarCraft 2 bot from scratch and compete against the other teams. We formed into teams of 3-4 and went from there.

My team was composed of:
* Boris Fleysher (That's me!)
* [Atharv Vohra]()
* [Hugh Bagan]()
* [Jolene Poulin](https://github.com/nienna73)
