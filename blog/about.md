## whoami
My name is Boris and I'm a recent(ish) Computing Science Specialization with the Game Development Certificate graduate from the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/). I was also an executive (Senior Representative specifically) for the [Undergraduate Association of Computing Science](http://ugweb.cs.ualberta.ca/~uacs/) in my last year. I've always been fond of technology and passionately believe that it can achieve just about anything! Hence, I decided to go into a technology-based field to study and learn how to shape the world around me. There isn't much more satisfying than putting together something and seeing it perform or do something, from something simple like sorting a list to more advanced problems like building a bot to play StarCraft 2! When I'm not tinkering with something, you'll likely find me playing board games or enjoying the great outdoors (when it's not too cold)!

Fun facts about me:
* Game jams are a great opportunity to try something new and I love to participate in them! Find a bunch of them on my [itch.io page](https://struckdown.itch.io/)
* I worked at a summer camp for several summers and got to lead activities like the climbing wall, zip-line and canoeing
* I built a StarCraft 2 bot in a team in a semester that placed 2nd out of 10 bots
* I can speak Russian fairly fluently
* Some of my favourite board games include: Dominion, Space Alert, Coup, The Resistance: Avalon and Galaxy Trucker. More recently, I've been playing Kingdom Death: Monster, Star Wars: Imperial Assault and Gloomhaven, so I've clearly fallen for some of the bigger campaign games
