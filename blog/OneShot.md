From November 10th 2018 to the 12th, I sat down with 3 other people to participate in the Video Game Art and Design's ([VGAD](https://vgad.org)) semi-annual Game Jam. We were given the theme of "You only have one" and were tasked with making a game in 48 hours. Paper comes out, ideas are being tossed out and we settle on the concept of "You only have one bullet". From there, OneShot was born.

OneShot is a game made in [Godot 3](https://godotengine.org), being built from almost scratch up. I had worked and developed [Black Soul](/BlackSoul) in the previous summer, so we quickly took the movement and camera from there to save time, but built everything else ourselves. From there, it was about prototyping and building up things as fast as possible.

Our team was composed of:
* [Boris Fleysher](https://github.com/Struckdown) - Lead Designer, Programmer/Developer
* [Quinlan Ede](https://github.com/Zalagan) - Audio, SFX, BGM
* [Yalmaz Abdullah](https://github.com/SledgeWorthIII) - Art, environment, sprites, character concepts/design
* [Nicolas Carpenter](https://github.com/NicoCarpe) - Level design, QA and programming/general support

It was a lot of fun and we think our game turned out pretty well, being quite fun to play for us.
