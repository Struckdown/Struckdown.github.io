In Summer 2018, my friend [Omer](github.com/omergosh) and myself were thinking about playing around in Unity to work on an RPG game idea we had, mostly to practice programming. We ended up accidentally stumbling across another one of our friend's, [Kieran](kierandowns.github.io) and he invited us to join him to make a game over the summer. And from there, we went on to make Black Soul.

Black Soul is a game made in [Godot 3](godotengine.org), built from the ground up. We started learning this engine, having never used it before and managed to make a top-down 2D action game in three months.
