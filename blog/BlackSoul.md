In Summer 2018, my friend [Omer](https://github.com/omergosh) and myself were thinking about playing around in Unity to work on an RPG game idea we had, mostly to practice programming. We ended up accidentally stumbling across another one of our friend's, [Kieran](https://kierandowns.github.io) and he invited us to join him to make a game over the summer. And from there, we went on to make Black Soul.

Black Soul is a game made in [Godot 3](https://godotengine.org), built from the ground up. We started learning this engine, having never used it before and managed to make a top-down 2D action game in three months. We ended up learning a good lesson in scope and the difficulties of getting everything done in a timely fashion, especially since this was a passion hobby project and many of us were doing other things like working full or part time and various other obligations.

The Team:
* [Kieran Downs](https://kierandowns.github.io) (Executive Producer, Audio)
* Boris Fleysher (Lead Developer, Lead Designer, Producer)
* Nelson Chen (Art, Sprites, Environment)
* [Taylor Folkersen](https://github.com/tfolkersen) (Programmer/Developer)
* [Omer Ahmed](https://github.com/Omergosh) (Programming Support)
* Jonas Liew (Story Direction)

I personally worked as the lead developer and designer for this project as well as taking on the role of the Producer to help hold meetings
and facilitate them when Kieran was unable to. The player movement, camera, enemy behaviour, projectiles, level design, game flow and feel were all designed and made by me.

Some neat things about the game:
* There's a secret bonus room that can be reached through some backtracking when the swap ability is unlocked
* Three different bullet types with variable shotgun effects lead to some pretty cool flower patterns from turrets
* The camera shake was based on what I learned from a talk on "juice in games", using an exponential decay
* The deflection mechanic went through several iterations as we tried to figure out what felt the best for calcuating the reflection

Here's a screenshot in the early portion of the game where the player needs to weave between bullets and use them to break glass to open up additional paths.
