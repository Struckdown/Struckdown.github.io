# Welcome!
Welcome to my website! This is a website about me, Boris, built by me using Github Pages and Jekyll for the purpose of learning something new! As well, it serves to showcase some of my previous projects.

## About me
My name is Boris and I'm a Computing Science Specialization and Game Development Certificate student at the University of Alberta in my fourth and final year. I am also an executive (Senior Representative specifically) for the Undergraduate Association of Computing Science. I've always been fond of technology and passionately believe that it can achieve just about anything! Hence, I decided to go into a technology-based field to study and learn how to shape the world around me. There isn't much more satisfying than putting together something and seeing it perform or do something, from something simple like sorting a list to more advanced problems like building a bot to play StarCraft 2! When I'm not tinkering with something, you'll likely find me playing board games or enjoying the great outdoors (when it's not too cold)!

Fun facts about me:
* I worked at a summer camp for several summers and got to lead activities like the climbing wall, zip-line and canoeing
* I built a StarCraft 2 bot in a team in a semester that placed 2nd out of 10 bots
* I can speak Russian fairly fluently and even read and write a little
* Some of my favourite board games include: Dominion, Space Alert, Coup, The Resistance: Avalon and Galaxy Trucker

## Projects
Below are a series of things I've been involved in, in no particular order.

### StarCraft 2 Bot - "SegFault"
Over the course of the Fall 2018 semester, working in a team of 4, we built a StarCraft 2 bot (named SegFault) from scratch and competed against other teams in the class. Our bot placed 2nd out of 10.

### Black Soul
Over Spring/Summer 2018, myself and 4 friends set out to make a 30-minute game prototype. Black Soul was the resulting outcome.

### Lost Light
In Winter 2017, I worked in a 6 person team to build a 30-minute game over the course of the semester using RPG Maker VX Ace. We went on to win an award and had a pretty sweet game too!
