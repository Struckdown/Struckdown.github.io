# Welcome!
Welcome to my website! This is a website about me, Boris, built by me using Github Pages and Jekyll for the purpose of learning something new! As well, it serves to showcase some of my previous projects. And a little bit about my life and journey. Maybe somebody will see this and it'll inspire them.

## whoami
My name is Boris and I'm a recent(ish) Computing Science Specialization with the Game Development Certificate graduate from the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/). I was also an executive (Senior Representative specifically) for the [Undergraduate Association of Computing Science](http://ugweb.cs.ualberta.ca/~uacs/) in my last year. I've always been fond of technology and passionately believe that it can achieve just about anything! Hence, I decided to go into a technology-based field to study and learn how to shape the world around me. There isn't much more satisfying than putting together something and seeing it perform or do something, from something simple like sorting a list to more advanced problems like building a bot to play StarCraft 2! When I'm not tinkering with something, you'll likely find me playing board games or enjoying the great outdoors (when it's not too cold)!

Fun facts about me:
* Game jams are a great opportunity to try something new and I love to participate in them! Find a bunch of them on my [itch.io page](https://struckdown.itch.io/)
* I worked at a summer camp for several summers and got to lead activities like the climbing wall, zip-line and canoeing
* I built a StarCraft 2 bot in a team in a semester that placed 2nd out of 10 bots
* I can speak Russian fairly fluently
* Some of my favourite board games include: Dominion, Space Alert, Coup, The Resistance: Avalon and Galaxy Trucker. More recently, I've been playing Kingdom Death: Monster, Star Wars: Imperial Assault and Gloomhaven, so I've clearly fallen for some of the bigger campaign games

## Projects and Career related
Below is my career path and a series of various projects and things I've been involved in, mostly relating to software development or game making, since that's my passion.


### End of 2021 Update
The year's coming to a close. This year, I participated in three game jams and a solo game dev project, plus got promoted to a permanent full time position as an IT Analyst II - Performance Tester. It's not game dev related, but it's been good for the interm. Hopefully I can make it back into game dev soon! The game jam games were a blast to make and all three were unique and rather high quality (for a game jam game). I made "Socks and Found", "Light House" and "The Last Dodo". The first was my first attempt into using Unity to make a game, all during a game jam. We made a slightly buggy game, but we did make a complete short experience! Light House was me returning to Godot for a game jam with a brand new team and just making something. We made a short puzzler game about redirecting light. And The Last Dodo was another Godot game where I learned how to use the animation tree player and revisited tilemaps, as well as making a boss fight with a giant Dutch robot. The solo game dev project, Star Shooters was mostly finished this year, though I have a teeny bit of polish to do before I publicly put it up on itch. I went through a lot of learning for that project as I had to learn how to setup every system myself and connect everything, all while trying to keep it maintainable for a solo dev over the course of the year.

### Virus Days
With the pandemic, vrCAVE went into hibernation and I found a position with Alberta Health Services. Here I worked initially as a IT Analyst I - Software Tester, but took on roles under the performance team due to a lack of manpower there. Which was great, because I got to learn a ton about bash scripting in a practical environment, even if it was mostly me trying to figure out better ways to solve our problems. While this isn't games focused, I'm still trying to do Game Jams on the side and practicing programming wherever I can.

### Graduation and vrCAVE
When I graduated in 2019, I was fortunate enough to find a position with [vrCAVE](vrcave.ca) as a junior game programmer! Seriously, they're awesome, check them out. I helped develop and program a chunk of The Time Travel Paradox release, as well as porting all the previous Escape rooms to the Oculus Quest! These are some really cool technologies and whoever you are that has stumbled across my website, I highly recommend trying out VR. Because it's really cool. Unless you get motion sick easily. But even then, maybe for a short period of time. 

### Fragments
To finish the Game Development Certificate in my final semester, Winter 2019, I took the capstone course which focused on making a game from start to finish in one semester without any hand holding! From here, I lead a small team to make Fragments!

### Git Emotional
I participated in the 2019 HackED at the University of Alberta! I worked together with 3 other brilliant students to build a tool that tracks the sentimental state of a Github repository based off commit messages!

### StarCraft 2 Bot - "SegFault"
Over the course of the Fall 2018 semester, working in a team of 4, we built a StarCraft 2 bot (named SegFault) from scratch and competed against other teams in the class. Our bot placed 2nd out of 10.

### Black Soul
Over Spring/Summer 2018, myself and 4 friends set out to make a 30-minute game prototype. Black Soul was the resulting outcome.

### OneShot
Over Reading Week in November 2018, I sat down for 48 hours in a team of 4 to build Oneshot, a short game using Godot 3.

### Outdoors Club Database
In Fall 2018, I worked with the University of Alberta Outdoors Club to create a rental application to reduce the waste of paper and help simplify the Outdoor Club's workflow.

### Research Assistant - Information Extraction
In Summer 2018, I worked under [Dr. Davood Rafiei](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~drafiei/) to extract facts and information from article-based corpea.

### Lost Light
In Winter 2017, I worked in a 6 person team to build a 30-minute game over the course of the semester using RPG Maker VX Ace. We went on to win an award and had a pretty sweet game too!

### Project Attitude
During Winter 2017, I worked on a 5 person team to build an android application similar to Twitter but for moods instead!

### DragonQuest
In Fall 2017, I made an adventure game using Twine 2 in a six person team. The primary constraint was that it had to be a text-based game.
